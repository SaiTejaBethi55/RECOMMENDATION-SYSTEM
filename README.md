##For this task, I developed a recommendation system to provide personalized suggestions using Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization techniques. The goal was to predict user preferences based on past behavior and recommend items they are likely to engage with. I used a dataset containing user-item interactions, such as ratings or purchase history, and preprocessed it to create a user-item matrix. For collaborative filtering, I implemented both user-based and item-based approaches to identify similarities and generate recommendations. For matrix factorization, I applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the interaction matrix into latent features, capturing hidden relationships between users and items. The system was evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and ranking-based metrics such as Precision@K and Recall@K. Recommendations were tested on sample users to demonstrate the system’s effectiveness. Recommendation systems have practical applications in e-commerce for product suggestions, streaming services for content recommendations, social media for friend and content suggestions, and educational platforms for personalized learning resources. While these systems improve personalization and engagement, they also face challenges like the cold start problem and potential bias toward popular items. The deliverable for this task is a Jupyter Notebook or a simple application that showcases recommendations along with evaluation metrics and analysis. This project demonstrates the complete development of a recommendation engine, from data preprocessing to generating and evaluating personalized suggestions, highlighting my ability to implement AI techniques that directly impact user experience and business value.
